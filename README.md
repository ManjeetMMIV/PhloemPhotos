üåø **Phloem Photos: A Visual Inspiration and Community Platform**


PhloemPhotos  "Capture the Essence!"  A community-driven platform for creators to find visual ideas, draw inspiration from a gallery of user-uploaded images, and share their own photographic work.


Phloem Photos is a high-quality, community-driven web application designed for creators and visual thinkers. It serves as a centralized gallery where users can search for inspiration, share their own photographic work, and engage with a curated feed of nature-inspired imagery.

This project demonstrates proficiency in the full-stack MERN-lite architecture, focusing on secure user authentication, efficient file handling, and robust database modeling.
